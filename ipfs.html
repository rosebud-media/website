      <h2>What is IPFS?</h2>
      <p>
        IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a decentralized, peer-to-peer file sharing network. Instead of relying on a centralized server, files are identified by their content (using a unique hash called a CID) and can be retrieved from any node that has a copy.

      <h2>Why We Use IPFS</h2>
      <p>
        We use IPFS to promote censorship resistance and ensure our articles remain accessible even if a centralized server fails. By distributing content across a network of nodes, we make it harder for any single entity to control or take down the information.

      <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
      <p>
        You can support our mission by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Running Your Own Node:</strong> Set up your own IPFS node. This not only helps the network but also ensures that you have direct access to content even if other nodes go offline.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pinning Content:</strong> Pin our article CIDs (or your own content) on your node. Pinning keeps files available on the network.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Submitting Articles:</strong> For article submissions, you can either email your content to us or, ideally, upload your article to IPFS and send us the CID.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you need help setting up an IPFS node, refer to the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.io/install/">IPFS documentation</a> for installation instructions.
