      <h2>Why Rosebud?</h2>
      <p>
        In the 1941 movie classic Citizen Kane, Kane inherits a newspaper and is shocked to find that much news is filtered and censored.
        Driven by his belief in honest reporting, he establishes principles that ensure the truth reaches the people.
        His dying word “Rosebud” recalls a simpler, untainted time, symbolizing the fight against agendas and censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by Kane’s determination, Rosebud World is built on the principles of integrity and free expression.
        We champion unfiltered, uncensored content and empower citizens to express their views without compromise.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Submit Articles</h2>
      <p>We currently accept submissions in one of two ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Submission Form:</strong> Use our <a href="https://rosebud.world/submit.html">online submission form</a>. This tool encrypts your article in your browser and uses the decentralized Matrix network to transfer your encrypted file. Our service then retrieves, decrypts, and uploads your article to IPFS while indexing it into our blog. Because we do not operate any servers that directly connect to you, we cannot see your IP address. (Note: The Matrix network does use IP addresses for node connections, so if you’re concerned about that, please use a VPN or Tor.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>IPFS Upload:</strong> Alternatively, you can load your article directly into IPFS. After uploading, submit the CID and required metadata using our submission form. If your article is encrypted (<a href="https://rosebud.world/encrypt.html">using our browser‑based encryption tool</a>), we will decrypt it and post it without any trace back to you as the author. Please follow our guidelines for submitting files via IPFS to ensure we have all the necessary metadata.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Once approved, articles are pinned on our IPFS node and listed <a href="articles.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note:</em> To help keep content online and censorship-resistant, feel free to pin any approved articles on your own IPFS node.
