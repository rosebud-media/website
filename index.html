      <h2>Why Rosebud?</h2>
      <p>
        In the 1941 movie classic Citizen Kane, Kane finds himself inheriting a newspaper.
        A man driven by principles and integrity, he's shocked to find that most news doesn't
        get reported with censorship and filtering only allowing a small select number of stories
        to make it to print.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kane doesn't believe this is the fair and so publishes a set of principles that the paper
        will live by. The principles set out that the news will be honest and will not serve any
        special interest. The people will hear the truth, whatever it may be. Kane's dying words
        were Rosebud, the name of his childhood sledge which signified to him a simpler time when
        he was free and not caught in a world of agendas, politics and special interests.
      </p>
      <h2>Declaration of Principles</h2>
